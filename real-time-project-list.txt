14. Building a File Upload Component
Create a component for uploading files (images, documents) with progress tracking.
Handle file validation (size, type) before upload.
Implement the file preview feature (e.g., image preview before uploading).
Integrate with an API for file storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Firebase, or your custom server).


15. Creating a Multi-Step Form with Conditional Rendering
Build a multi-step form for complex inputs (e.g., survey, checkout process).
Implement dynamic steps based on previous answers using conditional rendering.
Manage state between form steps and validate each step independently.


16. Building a Drag-and-Drop Interface
Use libraries like react-dnd or react-beautiful-dnd to implement drag-and-drop functionality.
Create draggable elements and configure drop zones.
Allow reordering items in lists or managing a Kanban-style board.


17. Building an Admin Panel
Create a role-based admin panel where admins can manage users, view analytics, and configure settings.
Implement data tables, form validation, and CRUD operations.
Use React Router for managing navigation between different sections of the admin dashboard.


18. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
Implement lazy loading to load components only when required, enhancing app performance.
Split the code at various points, such as large libraries or routes, to ensure faster initial load time.


19. Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)
Implement internationalization (i18n) using libraries like react-i18next to make your app multilingual.
Set up dynamic translations, right-to-left (RTL) support, and date/time formatting for different locales.
